## To-be-implemented / Planned

* Get initial 2-board UI displayed
  - To start, left board is human v AI, right board tracks moves
  - Then setup right board to offer stockfish suggestions
  - At this point, could be deployed as single player static site
* Implement node-graphql API to track games, players, etc.
* Tie UI into API, add interface elements for signup, login, game selection, etc.
