# Pear Runtime AI Compatibility

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING (Stub Mode)

The AI module has been updated to be compatible with Pear Runtime by providing stub implementations when full Stockfish engine features are not available.

## What Works
- ✅ **Application startup** - No more import crashes
- ✅ **Opening book** - Pure JavaScript, works in all environments  
- ✅ **AI module interface** - Consistent API whether using stubs or real engines
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** - Application works without AI features

## Current Implementation
- **Stub Engine** (`engine-stub.js`) - Provides placeholder responses
- **Opening Book** (`opening-book.js`) - Full chess opening database works
- **AI Interface** (`index.js`) - Uses stubs, maintains same API

## When Real AI Will Work
The full Stockfish integration will work when:
1. **Node.js environment** - `external-engine-simple.js` with system Stockfish
2. **Native binding** - When CMake native module is built for Bare runtime
3. **Alternative engines** - WebAssembly Stockfish in browsers

## Migration Path
When real engines become available:
```javascript
// Replace in index.js:
import { StubEngine } from './engine-stub.js'
// With:
import { SimpleStockfishEngine } from './external-engine-simple.js'
```

## For Developers
The application now starts successfully and the AI module provides:
- Consistent API interface
- No crashes on initialization
- Clear logging when using stubs vs real engines
- Opening book functionality regardless of engine availability

This ensures the chess application works fully even when advanced AI features are not available in the current runtime environment.
